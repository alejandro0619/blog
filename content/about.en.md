## 🌟 A brief introduction about me

I'm a 17 years old software engineering student and math enthusiast from Venezuela. I've worked with [Javascript](https://www.javascript.com/) & [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) in both [Deno](https://deno.land/) and [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) runtimes and I'm currently focused on [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/).

> I just want to prove Javascript is not stuck to the web browser anymore!

Most of my projects are about creating CLI utilies to ship a brand new way to utilize  useful apps without taking off your hands from the keyword. As developers, we know we love that terminal ***look n' feel***.

## 📍 The projects I've done so far
