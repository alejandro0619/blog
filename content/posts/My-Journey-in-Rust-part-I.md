## Introduction

If you have been in a cave for the last year, you might not notice there's a language that's **been rising** and **gathering power**, it's name is **Rust**.
If I had to describe it in one phrase, I'd  totally agree with it's brief but true description shown in  [the official page](https://www.rust-lang.org/):

> A language empowering everyone
to build reliable and efficient software.

## Why is it so popular lately

Rust was the most loved language for the last six years, by the annual [stackoverflow survey](https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/2021#most-loved-dreaded-and-wanted-language-love-dread), but why?
I think it'd be easier if I introduce myself, at least a bit.

As said [in my about-page](https://spaghettidev.tech/about). I'm a Javascript/Typescript developer and I've worked in shiping a brand new way to utilize applications right from your terminal. I learned Javascript back in 2020 when I started coding, in fact, it was the first time I was using my old laptop for something that wasn't Youtube or Google.

And I truly think that **Javascript is a great language** but as every interpreted language, when it comes to performance, it isn't the best option out there. Let's dig further into this.

Imagine that you're a startup's developer, your team plans to develop a web API, after knowing your client's requirements you are up to choose your tech stack, and there'll be a thought that will come to your mind.

> What should I choose?

In this case you need to think about what are your team's priorities. If your team need fast development you should go for a interpreted one, otherwise, you should pick up a compiled language (to aim performance).

So now we can divide this in two main sections:

- Rust vs an interpreted language.
- Rust vs a compiled language.
